The problem that is often encountered by customers is if they make inbound calls, when busy times they have to wait for a queue to be connected to the relationship manager. And often customers stop dialling because they wait too long.

There are also many end customers who are worried about their privacy when they are made customer profiles by relationship managers because they are afraid that their personal data will be sold to advertising marketers and make them not want to make the customer profile tool.

Some customers who get a lower score after making inbound calls feel they are not being served well. According to them, this method is unfair because relationship managers should serve their customers randomly.

Sometimes during busy times, the customer is asked to give reasons in a few words and then it will redirect the call to an Automatic Call Distributor. But after doing that sometimes they are still not served by relationship managers and many of them hang up the call because they wait too long and they feel uncertain in waiting.
