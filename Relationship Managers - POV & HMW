Deriving from the relationship managers assumptions, the following are subsequent point-of-view (POV) statements 
and how-might-we (HMW) that will address such issues. 

Statment 1:
- We met... a relationship manager who was struggling with his sales
- We were surprised to notice... he had spoken at length to prospective customers whose intent to purchase did not match their inquiry for more knowledge
- We wonder if this means... there's too many customers coming through without intent to purchase and are occupying higher skilled relationship managers who are better suited to converting people rather than communicating pure information
- It would be game changing to... for different RMs of varying abilities and experiences to deal with more appropriate situations and customers befitting these attributes

HMW - How Might We ensure that call flow is segregated for RMs to save time and efficiency 

Statement 2:
- We met... someone who had an important customer dissatisfied with the constant holds and hung up on him	
- We were surprised to notice... this customer was keen to acquire more details and make a purchase, despite having a low score according to the preloaded criteria 
- We wonder if this means... the preloaded criteria is assigning more priority to people with supposedly high scores but only coming for inquiries. However, people with low scores - but intention to buy, end up with less priority and therefore longer waits. 
- It would be game changing to... ensure that people will inquire a lot before forming intention to buy are not left out at the bottom of the queue.
			
HMW - How Might We ensure that the system does not get so caught up in the preloaded criteria so customers are generally treated more fairly.

Statement 3:
- We met a… relationship manager who was unable to access important information about her customer and ended up losing the sale.
- We were surprised to see… that there was no system that would automatically display the information of the customer she was speaking to.
- We pondered if… having such a system would help RM’s better assist their customers and make more sales.
- It would be innovative to... create a system that would automatically retrieve and display customer information as well as provide a script for the RM.

HMW - How Might We assist relationship managers when they are making calls so they can make more sales.

Statement 4:
- We met a… newly hired relationship manager who was unable to make a sale with a highly lucrative customer.
- We were surprised to see… that such a valuable customer was assigned to a new RM with limited knowledge & experience.
- We wondered if… matching high-value clients with experienced RM’s would increase the chance of the sale being made.
- It would be ground-breaking to… develop a system that would determine the value of a client and assign them to experienced RM’s.

HMW - How Might We develop a system that gives our most valuable customers the best information and service?
