Deriving from the relationship managers assumptions, the following are subsequent point-of-view (POV) statements 
and how-might-we (HMW) that will address such issues. 

We met... a relationship manager who was struggling with his sales
We were surprised to notice... he had spoken at length to prospective customers whose intent to purchase did not match their inquiry for more knowledge
We wonder if this means... there's too many customers coming through without intent to purchase and are occupying higher skilled relationship managers who are better suited to converting people rather than communicating pure information
It would be game changing to... for different RMs of varying abilities and experiences to deal with more appropriate situations and customers befitting these attributes

HMW - How Might We ensure that call flow is segregated for RMs to save time and efficiency
