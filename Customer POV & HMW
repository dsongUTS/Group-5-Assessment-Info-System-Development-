Customer POV and HMW

We met ... a customer who was dissatisfied with wait times
We were surprised to notice ... he had waited 30 minutes in queue
We wonder if this means ... that the current system is too slow at handling enquiries
It would be game changing to ... be able to estimate the time a customer's enquiry will take and give some priority to short calls

How might we ... increase the speed at which the queue is emptied




We met ... a customer who always hung up our outbound calls
We were surprised to notice ... he viewed our calls as spam
We wonder if this means ... that most customers view our outbound calls as harrasment
It would be game changing to ... be able to identify customers who don't like receiving outbound calls

How might we ... identify and call customers who would like to receive our calls




We met ... a customer who was dissapointed by the results of their enquiry
We were surprised to notice ... that our RM lacked knowledge in the product the customer was interested in
We wonder if this means ... Our customers aren't being paired with appropriate RMs
It would be game changing to ... identify a customer's interested product in advance so they can be paired with an appropriate RM

How might we ... pair customer's with RMs that have signficant knowledge on a user's preffered products
