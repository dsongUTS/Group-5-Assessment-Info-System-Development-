Backlog 2
  1. Compile and consolidate the empathy maps for each stakeholder group
        Nik - Relationship Managers
        Fajiris - Customers 
  2. Begin idea generation
        List key assumptions of the RMs and customers based on empathy maps 
          Daniel & Nik - RMs
          Fajiris & Khurshid - Customers
        Each member then forms POV statements based off these assumptions and the other converts to HMW statements
        (However both members can work on both together)
          RMs
            Daniel - POV
            Nik - HMW 
          Customers
            Fajiris - POV
            Khurshid - HMW
