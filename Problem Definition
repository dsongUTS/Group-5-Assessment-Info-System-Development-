Problem Definition

For a premier travel company offering packages to destinations around the world, 
it would be expected that the customer service would be of the highest quality.
Communication with new and existing customers is predominantly handled by the in-house call management centre (CMC), 
which in its current state is lacking the ability to efficiently meet the businessâ€™s needs.
The relationship mangers (RMs) ability to make sales and provide services is being bottlenecked by the limited features of the current system,
leading to lost sales and customers.
To solve these issues, a new system has been proposed that would greatly increase the efficiency of the CMC as well assist RMs in day-to-day tasks.
